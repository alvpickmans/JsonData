# JsonData
JsonData is a [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.org) package to provide extra functionalities when handling data, based on Newtonsoft JsonNet C# library.

 It can handle primitive object types (`string`, `int`, `double`, etc.) as well as `Autodesk.DesignScript` and `Revit` object types. Non-primitive objects are kept intact along the graph, only converted to its string representation when writing to file.

For extensive example of the package functionalities, open the `JsonDataSample.dyn` file that can be found on the package folder.
